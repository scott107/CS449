# CS449

instructions for running:

	use an android device instead of an emulator.
	
	location permissions are required for functiolnal use.

	current GPS coordinates are displayed, and saved in the DB (currently on location change instead of daily as my services
	are not currently working).

	yesterday's distance is also displayed (currently displays in parellel with current, since DB updates are happening more
	than once per day).
